# EAGE-Annual-Hackathon-2022
Hackathon at the 83rd EAGE Annual Conference &amp; Exhibition in Madrid, June 5th - 6th 2022

# Theme: Explainable AI â€“ how do we demonstrate that the machine learning models we develop and use are behaving as we expect?

# Participant Guide

*This is a hybrid event* â€“ what does that mean?  This means that the hackathon teams can either be in person, remote, or even split between the two!  The facilitators will be both online and in person in Madrid.  Plenum sessions will be held online â€“ including the introduction and final presentations â€“ but the hacking can be done in the best way your team sees fit!

This event will be facilitated in English.

## What you need to do as a hackathon participant:
1. Before the hackathon: Find a team if you donâ€™t already have one.  We will use a Github discussion board â€“ so if you are looking for a team to join or have a topic that you would like some people to help you work on â€“ please post.
- There will be some time on Sunday morning to finalize the teams, but the expectation is that you have tried to find a team upfront.
2. Before the hackathon: Get your team ready!
- If you are attending remotely â€“ find a good place for you or your team to work with good internet connection â€“ coffee shop, somewhere at the university, or at a teammateâ€™s home.  We highly recommend that those attending remotely from the same city try to collocate in person even if you arenâ€™t on the same team!
- If you are coming to Madrid â€“ you will need to bring your laptop, headset, and power cable.
- Ideate around the technical challenge your team will work on.  You can use our Github discussion board for this.  Remember the theme!
- What data do you need?
- Are you going to use an existing model or build one from scratch?
 - What technology will your team use (python packages, dashboards, interpreters..etc)
The facilitators will provide some ideas to get you thinking - you can find this thread in the discussion board above.
3. Familiarize yourself with the agenda.
- This is a fairly short hackathon.  Your team will be expected to present your final outcome on Monday afternoon at 15:00.  That means code freeze will happen at 13:00.
- With your team, try to come up with a plan of attack keeping in mind the short time.
4. Yes, there will be a final presentation from each team with two teams up for award from a judging panel of experts and from the hackathon participants.
- The facilitators will reveal the criteria for the presentation Monday morning (this is so you can focus on your work and not on creating a presentation ðŸ˜Š)
- Remember to take screenshots, record methods, and document your thought process along the way â€“ this will help you to faster put together a final presentation.
5. During the hackathon â€“ all participants need to join the 3 online plenum sessions â€“ the introduction on Day 1, CODE FREEZE on Day 2, and the Final Presentations and Voting on Day 2.  These sessions will be held online and links to online meeting rooms will be provided.  Only the final presentation session will be recorded.
